SAGA for Processing
-------------------
SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) is intended to give
scientists an effective but easily learnable platform for implementing
geoscientific methods. This is achieved by the application programming
interface (API). SAGA has a fast-growing set of geoscientific methods,
bundled in exchangeable module libraries.

Processing is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call native
and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks
more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements SAGA GIS provider for QGIS Processing framework.
Based on SAGA GIS 2.3.1.
